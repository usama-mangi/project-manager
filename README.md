# Full-Stack Task Manager (MERB Stack)

![task_manager](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e021aff-4ed5-425d-889f-178e035bb3c2)

This is a comprehensive, full-stack task management application built with a modern "MERB" stack: **MongoDB, Express, React, and Bun**.

This platform is a collaborative tool where users can manage projects, create and assign tasks, and build teams to work together efficiently. The entire project is written in **TypeScript** and leverages the **Bun** runtime for both the backend server and the frontend development environment, showcasing high performance and modern JavaScript/TypeScript tooling.

## Core Features

### 1. User & Authentication
* **Secure Registration:** New user sign-up with password hashing using `bcrypt`.
* **JWT Authentication:** Stateless authentication using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**. The token is stored in a cookie and automatically attached to all API requests via an Axios interceptor.
* **Profile Management:** Users can view their profile and upload a custom profile picture using `multer` for file handling on the backend.
* **Auth State Persistence:** `useAuthStore` (Zustand) initializes on app load, checking for a valid token and user data to maintain the session.

### 2. Team Management
* **Full CRUD for Teams:** Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete teams they own.
* **Admin & Member Roles:** The user who creates a team is designated as the `admin`.
* **Team Membership:**
    * Admins can search for users by username or email and add them to the team.
    * Admins can remove members from the team.
    * Non-admin members have the option to "Leave Team".
* **Detailed View:** A dedicated team details page shows all team members and all projects assigned to that team.

### 3. Project Management
* **Full CRUD for Projects:** Users can create, edit, and delete their own projects.
* **Project Status:** Projects can be set to "Active," "On-Hold," or "Completed".
* **Team Assignment:** The project creator (or team admin) can assign a project to a specific team, linking it to all team members.
* **Detailed View:** A project details page shows the project description, dates, assigned team, and a complete list of all associated tasks.

### 4. Task Management
* **Full CRUD for Tasks:** Users can create, edit, and delete tasks within their projects.
* **Task Properties:** Tasks include a name, description, due date, and a priority level ("low," "medium," "high").
* **Task Status:** Tasks follow a Kanban-style flow: "To Do," "In-Progress," or "Done".
* **User Assignment:** Team admins can assign specific tasks to any member of the team associated with the project.
* **Kanban View:** The "My Tasks" page organizes all user-relevant tasks into three columns based on their status.

### 5. Dashboard
* **At-a-Glance Stats:** The main dashboard provides a high-level overview of the user's workload, including counts for Teams, Projects, Total Tasks, Assigned Tasks, and Finished Tasks.
* **Quick Actions:** Provides shortcuts to create new teams, projects, or tasks.
* **Task & Project Lists:** Shows filterable lists of "This Week's Tasks" and "To Do" tasks, as well as horizontal carousels for all current projects and teams.

## Technical Showcase & Architecture

This project demonstrates a modern, efficient, and scalable full-stack architecture.

### 🚀 The "MERB" Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Bun)
The entire project is built using the **Bun.js** runtime, replacing Node.js.
* **Backend:** Bun serves the Express API, running TypeScript directly with no separate build step (`bun run --watch index.ts`).
* **Frontend:** Bun acts as the package manager, bundler, and dev server (`bun --hot src/index.tsx`), replacing tools like Vite or Webpack and offering significantly faster performance.

### Backend (Server)
* **Framework:** **Express.js** with a modular, RESTful API structure (`routes`, `controllers`, `models`).
* **Database:** **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** for strongly-typed schema modeling, including relational data using `ref` to link users, teams, projects, and tasks.
* **Authentication:** Secure, stateless JWT authentication middleware (`auth.middleware.ts`) protects all sensitive routes.
* **Data Aggregation:** The backend features a highly efficient `/api/user/data` endpoint. This single request fetches all teams, projects, and tasks related to the logged-in user, which is then used to hydrate the entire frontend state at once.
* **File Uploads:** Uses `multer` to handle `multipart/form-data` for profile picture uploads.

### Frontend (Client)
* **Framework:** **React 19** with functional components and hooks.
* **Global State Management (Zustand):**
    * **Modular Stores:** State is split into logical, hook-based stores (`auth.store.ts`, `project.store.ts`, `task.store.ts`, `team.store.ts`).
    * **Optimistic UI:** CRUD operations (e.g., `task.store.ts`) use an optimistic UI pattern. The local Zustand state is updated *immediately* for a snappy user experience, and then reverted only if the subsequent API call fails.
* **Routing (React Router v7):**
    * **Data Loaders:** The app uses React Router `loader` functions (`dataLoaders.ts`) to fetch all essential data *before* the main routes render.
    * **Zustand Hydration:** This loader pattern is combined with Zustand. The `dataLoader` fetches the aggregated `/user/data` and immediately hydrates all Zustand stores (`useTeamStore.setState`, `useProjectStore.setState`, etc.) before the app becomes visible.
    * **Protected Routes:** `AppRouter.tsx` programmatically serves authenticated routes or auth routes based on the `authStore`'s `isAuthenticated` flag.
* **Form Handling & Validation (React Hook Form + Zod):**
    * Uses **React Hook Form** for efficient, performance-oriented form state management.
    * Uses **Zod** (`validation/schemas.ts`) to define validation schemas for all forms (login, register, project, task), providing robust, type-safe validation.
* **Asynchronous API Calls:**
    * A centralized **Axios** instance (`config/api.ts`) is used for all API communication.
    * An interceptor automatically attaches the JWT `Bearer` token (read from cookies) to all outgoing requests.
* **Advanced Abstractions:**
    * **Custom Modal Hooks:** A generic `useModals` hook provides a clean API to manage modal state (open, close, data). This is extended by specific hooks like `useTaskModals`, `useProjectModals`, and `useTeamModals` to handle all modal logic (Create, Edit, Delete, Assign) for each entity, keeping page components clean and focused.
    * **Custom Form Hooks:** Logic for login/register forms is encapsulated in custom hooks (`useLoginForm.ts`, `useRegisterForm.ts`) to separate form logic from the component.
* **UI & Animations:**
    * **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework (with `bun-plugin-tailwind`) is used for all styling.
    * **Anime.js:** Used for subtle, engaging micro-interactions and page-load animations, such as staggered entry for lists and interactive button effects.
